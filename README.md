Brampton Booster explores the hidden depths of Cardfight!! Vanguard by applying multiple areas of academics to a card game. It uses logic and curiosity to foster research and prove findings with Game Theory, Mathematics, and Programming. By encouraging transparent research and open source programs it allows the metagame and scientific community to validate, understand, and ultimately improve.

#### About me

Ever since I heard a glimpse of JAM Project "Vanguard" I became slightly obsessed with Vanguard (Which means before the anime even started...I'm so old) . First deck was Japanese OTT but now have Goku, Raindear, DeathRex, Voidmaster/everything, Stern, and a couple of grade one rush builds. I am in a pretty good community with about two dozen other casual and semi-comptetitive fighters. Other hobbies I have include chess, math, tennis, smash, fighting games, and sharing neat stuff. Anyways this blog uses game theory, mathematics, and programming to foster technical research and findings to explore all Vanguard has to offer. Despite my large periods of absence you can shoot any comments or questions to me and I'll respond very quickly. Hope you enjoy your time here.
